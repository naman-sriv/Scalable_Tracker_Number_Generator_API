# !.vscode/settings.json
# !.vscode/extensions.json
# !.vscode/launch.json
# !.vscode/tasks.json

# Operating System Files

# Docker
# Ignore Docker build context files that are not needed in the image
# This is typically handled by .dockerignore, but good to have here too.
# For your Dockerfile.dev, you're copying target/*.jar, so target/ should be ignored.
